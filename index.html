      <p>A top banker and former anti-corruption buster have been picked as key advisers by Nigeria's new President Bola Tinubu.

        They are among eight special presidential advisers appointed on Thursday to help bring in reforms in the Africa’s largest economy.
        
        Olawale Edun, an economist with a background in merchant banking and corporate and international finance, will advise on monetary policy while Nuhu Ribadu, former head of anti-graft agency the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), will advise on security.
        
        The speed with which the newly inaugurated president is selecting his team has been greeted with relief by many Nigerians.
        
        His predecessor Muhammadu Buhari was nicknamed “Baba-go-slow” for taking up to six months to make up his mind about appointments when he took office eight years ago.
        
        The special advisers - often technocrats - are part of the president’s cabinet but unlike ministers they do not hold a ministerial portfolio.</p>

      <p>Another Nigerian chef, Damilola Adeparusi, better known as Chef Dammy, has made an attempt to break the non-stop-cooking world record.

        She recently completed 120 hours of cooking, but it is not clear that Guinness World Records (GWR) has received an application for her efforts to be recognised.
        
        Chef Dammy's feat came just after GWR recognised Hilda Baci as the world-record holder saying that she cooked non-stop for 93 hours 11 minutes.
        
        That effort caused a nationwide sensation.
        
        Chef Dammy told BBC News Yoruba that she was "not competing with anyone". "The sky is wide enough for the birds to avoid colliding," she added.
        
        She received some criticism online for making the record attempt just after Chef Baci but she told the BBC that she had "no idea of people bullying her".
        
        Meanwhile, GWR says that its tweet about Chef Baci breaking the record is its "best performing tweet of all time":</p>

      <p>A survivor of Nigeria's boat accident in River Niger that has claimed 106 lives has told the BBC that many women died trying to save their children.

        The boat capsized after part of the vessel collapsed, causing water to flood the boat, police said.
        
        Figures provided by local rescuers indicate that 144 people survived the boat accident.
        
        One village in the Patigi local government area of Kwara state, where the incident occurred, had the highest number of casualties. Locals there say 61 died, mostly women and children.
        
        Mohammed Alhassan, a survivor, said the women would not leave their children and so they drowned together.
        
        “My sister was with us on the boat,” he told the BBC. “She survived but her seven-year-old son died".
        
        Aisha Mohammed, another woman who lost her three grown daughters in the accident said the girls were soon to be married.
        
        Other survivors also described how many fathers hung on to some of their children while those they could not bring to shore died.
        
        Some young men were however able to swim to safety after the boat broke in half.
        
        Safety is one of the major concerns raised as many people did not have life jackets. Overloaded boats are common and travellers often don't take safety precautions.</p>
